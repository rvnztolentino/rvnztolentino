                        Boy oh boy where do I even begin. Lebron... honey, my pookie bear. I have loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you. The way you drive into the paint and strike fear into your enemies&apos; eyes. Your silky smooth touch around the rim, and that gorgeous jumpshot. I would do anything for you. I wish it were possible to freeze time so I would never have to watch you retire. You had a rough childhood, but you never gave up hope. You are even amazing off the court, you&apos;re a great husband and father, sometimes I even call you dad. I forever dread and weep, thinking of the day you will one day retire. I would sacrifice my own life if it were the only thing that could put a smile on your beautiful face. You have given me so much joy, and heartbreak over the years. I remember when you first left Cleveland and it&apos;s like my heart got broken into a million pieces. But a tear still fell from my right eye when I watched you win your first ring in Miami, because deep down, my glorious king deserved it. I just wanted you to return home. Then alas, you did, my sweet baby boy came home and I rejoiced. 2015 was a hard year for us, baby, but in 2016 you made history happen. You came back from 3-1 and I couldn&apos;t believe it. I was crying, bawling even, and I heard my glorious king exclaim these words, &quot;CLEVELAND, THIS IS FOR YOU!&quot; Not only have you changed the game of basketball and the world forever, but you&apos;ve eternally changed my world. And now you&apos;re getting older, but still the goat, my goat.<br></br><br></br> I love you, pookie bear, my glorious king, LeBron James.☺️♥️🫶🏻
